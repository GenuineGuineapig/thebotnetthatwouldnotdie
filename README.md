# The botnet that would not die
A seminar paper about the botnet that would not die. 

This paper originated from my seminar work in the summer semester 2019 at the University of Applied Sciences Wedel, which was supervised by Prof. Dr. Beuster. It is about persistent botnets and the challenges we face in perspective to the ongoing developments in this field of cybersecurity.
